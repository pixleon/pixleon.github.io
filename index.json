I will try to use the local community ESG for this. Even though I am not a super active member of ESG (yet) it has already given me a lot. There are some areas of game development where I still have a lot to learn, marketing being one of them. I have gotten some really nice tips/links related to marketing and other topics, but even though I have not used it all yet I have gained some valuable knowledge.\nDuring the polish phase of Marbleous Blocks I have changed the look of the game a bit, giving it a bit more personality. I have also introduced a clear but simple story. Your goal is to help our marble hero Max retrieve the missing orbs and make sure the rainbow gets its colors back. Marbleous Blocks was never meant to be a story heavy game but that does not mean there should not be any story. A good story can help a lot with immersion and can motivate the player to keep playing. I still think that the game mechanics and how it feels to interact with the game is more important than the actual story, but to create a great game I think you need both, and a lot of other ingredients of course.\nSo what more have I done lately? Well, among other things I have created Steam achievements, rewritten some texts related to the game and reworked the old trailer. If you have any feedback on the new trailer or anything else please let me know.\n   \nAnd oh, here is the link to the Steam page!\n","date":1603497600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603497600,"objectID":"1e81a83e52b98c4a804a5b3f816db030","permalink":"/post/polish/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/polish/","section":"post","summary":"The development of Marbleous Blocks is still going in the right direction.

I have done some other tasks as well but this post will mostly focus on graphics related work.\nHere is a list of the topics I have been digging into:\n Anti aliasing. Bloom. Normal mapping. Environment mapping. Tweak SSAO. Outline for blocks to be placed. Blender sculpting, decimation and UV-mapping. Eye highlight.  Anti aliasing  Up until now I have relied on the GPU built-in FXAA solution to reduce \u0026ldquo;jaggies\u0026rdquo; when rendering frames for Marbleous Blocks. It is fast and gets the job done but it can also have a negative effect on the crispness of the rendered frame. This was very apparent when rendering text elements for the level editor. There is also a risk that the user playing the game does not have FXAA enabled.\nTo overcome this I have looked into other alternatives. There is a relatively new TAA solution that seems to be pretty popular nowadays, there is the OpenGL built-in MSAA solution and there are a couple of different versions of the already mentioned FXAA solution. Since MSAA is not recommended to use together with deferred rendering I decided to start by implementing FXAA. I realized there were already plenty of FXAA samples and finally I decided to port the following solution found on ShaderToy.\nThe result is better compared to no anti aliasing but it is not as good as the FXAA option found in the Nvidia control panel. I have not digged deeper into this yet though.\nThe HUD elements in the game are rendered using a forward rendering pass (blending it over the deferred rendered pass). For this part of the frame I was able to use the OpenGL built-in MSAA solution. Even though this is just a small detail of the entire frame I think it gave the game a much better look. This last part was actually a little bit tricky. The OpenGL library I use, GLEW, was pretty picky with how to activate this. If you have trouble getting this to work yourself please send an email and I will try to help out.\nBloom  Some of the play testers have had problems understanding that you cannot transport the marble across connector blocks. I do not blame them. Since they appeared solid the testers were frustrated when the marble passed through them. I needed something that conveyed the idea of energy and light. I needed the possibility to express a glow like effect.\nI started exploring possibilities to implement this and once again I found a great article on Learn OpenGL. I want to underline that Learn OpenGL has been a fantastic resource throughout this entire project. The articles are great and there are even source code samples you can play around with.\nWith the sample code and text to go with that it did not take long time until I had a first solution up and running.\nNormal mapping  By using normal maps it is possible to squeeze in a lot more surface detail without paying a high price in terms of performance. Since I use Assimp, to load my FBX models, and it can calculate tangent space vectors it was not that much of work to support tangent space normal maps in the engine. First I played around with pretty agressive normal maps but it did not really contribute as much as I would have hoped. Instead I decided to use a more subtle effect, just to add some variation between the blocks used in the game.\nEnvironment mapping  There are a few different blocks in the game and some have different meanings. Like the energy blocks that are needed to \u0026ldquo;pay\u0026rdquo; for blocks being placed in the game. I did not have a distinct look for these so I was thinking I should rely on the old \u0026ldquo;gold\u0026rdquo; look for this. Obviously I needed a way to render sharp reflections.\nThe easiest trick in the book for this is by using cube maps. Once I got it working and changed the look to something gold like it just did not feel right. Instead I ended up giving the energy blocks a look that relates to the glowing green connectors. I hope this will help the player to make the connection (no pun intended) between the energy blocks you pick up and the cost of the blocks you place in the game. We will see if this actually works out during future play testing.\nTweak SSAO  When I added support for bloom I noticed some nasty SSAO artifacts. I did have some artifacts before but it got way worse. Since something needed to change I started to look into various ways to tweak the existing solution. Removing SSAO completely was never an option since this effect is crucial to give the game a decent look.\nThe result was a more cartoon like effect which fits well into the game.\nOutline for blocks to be placed  In order to improve interpretation of blocks being placed I added an outline around them. Since I render these without any SSAO this makes it easier to see the actual shapes of the blocks being placed.\nBlender sculpting, decimation and UV-mapping  Even though I like the wooden look of the blocks I got some feedback concerning them all looking the same. I decided to try out a stone look instead. How to model stones? Blender to the rescue. Once again I got the chance to use Blender and even though it was not without frustration it worked out pretty well.\nI learnt a few new things concerning sculpting and started thinking about buying a Wacom. This video was a great source of inspiration. When something has been sculpted you need to reduce it in order to be able to use it in real-time. The reduction worked pretty well. I needed to do some hand tweaking to remove T-junctions etc but overall it worked out fine. Then I used a Blender feature called \u0026ldquo;Smart UV Project\u0026rdquo; in order to be able to map a stone texture to the blocks.\nI also introduced some randomness when selecting how a block is being rotated in the game giving the games look a bit more variation. This could easily be improved further by adding a few more textures and normal maps (as discussed earlier).\nEye highlight  Last but not least I changed how the eye highlight is being rendered. Before I used an additional mesh for it. It works but it does not look natural. So instead I added an extra light source placed close to the camera to contribute with some specular effects. It is a hack but I think it worked out pretty good.\n","date":1596931200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596931200,"objectID":"d744bd2db6784e0b112a504c9f8e393f","permalink":"/post/graphics/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/graphics/","section":"post","summary":"Lately I have been focusing my work on extending the graphics capabilities of the Pixleon engine.

More puzzles. Undo \u0026amp; Redo. Marble expression. Marketing.  Raft feature  I have added a feature that allows the player to move already placed blocks. This adds a nice new dimension to the game and opens up the door for some interesting puzzles. I still have not fully explored the possibilities this feature enables but I have created a few new puzzles based on this mechanic.\nMore puzzles  I am starting to see the end of the tunnel. Currently I have 41 puzzles. The five worlds are nearly completed. I still have four puzzles to go, including the final puzzle that will be a bit bigger. Then I plan to add a few hidden puzzles to reward curious/dedicated players. I think there is a good variety of puzzles but I am not sure about the difficulty level. I need to make sure there are no brutal roadblocks, otherwise players will most likely give up. I want the game to be challenging but not impossible or unfair. More feedback is definitely needed to reach that goal.\nUndo \u0026amp; Redo  I got some great feedback concerning the lack of being able to undo a \u0026ldquo;move\u0026rdquo;. This is particularly annoying if you simply slipped a bit with the mouse. Marbleous Blocks does not want to punish the player for something like that as it is not fun nor interesting. So to overcome this annoyance I have implemented support for undo \u0026amp; redo based on the simple idea presented by Dennis Gustafsson. I think this is a nice contribution to the game as it removes an unwanted source of frustration.\nMarble expression  I recently joined ESG to get more game development related inspiration but also try to give some back. The ESG community provided me with some nice feedback concerning the lack of story elements in Marbleous Blocks. This got me thinking more about this and even though Marbleous Blocks will not be a story rich game it would still benefit from a back story. Just by creating a backstory I saw the need for a more vivid main character opposed to a simple marble. So I decided to add eyes and eyebrows to the main character in order to convey some kind of expression. This gives the game a more cartoonish, or if you wish childish, look but I hope this will not drive away serious players. I guess time will tell.\nI also got the opportunity to dust off some of my old modeling and animation skills. With some simple keyframe animations of the eyebrows and some animations of the eyes, based on where the player\u0026rsquo;s mouse cursor is located, I managed to bring life to our so far unnamed marbleous hero.\nMarketing  Just like most developers I spend most of my time on actual development. From my somewhat narrow perspective, there is nothing wrong with that but if no one knows about your game or application no one will play or use it, and to no surprise I want people to play my game. So I have watched a few interesting videos related to marketing, learnt some new stuff and are currently trying to apply some of that knowledge. I realize that I like most parts of game development, even marketing related efforts. I still have lots of things to learn about marketing but I like learning new things. In fact I find learning new things fundamental to happiness, at least for myself.\nI recently started using Twitter in an attempt to find a bit more spot light. We will see how it pans out.\n","date":1595030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595030400,"objectID":"7a103bcdacfc09abb3f0cddaf318943f","permalink":"/post/expression/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/expression/","section":"post","summary":"No post in a while but I continued working on Marbleous blocks and in particular I have been focusing on:\n Raft feature.

A lot of different things actually, but here is an overview:","tags":null,"title":"Beta release","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I think it is about time I share a bit more information about the game I am working on and what I have been up to during the last couple of weeks.\nThe game is called Marbleous Blocks. It is a minimalistic 3D-puzzle/physics game, that consist of several small puzzles. Each puzzle is composed of a few floating platforms and the goal is to guide a marble between those platforms. In order to do so you need to carefully place Tetris-like block pieces between the floating platforms. However, in order to forge a piece, you need a blueprint for the piece and enough block energy. So, it is not just a matter of finding a valid path, you also need to think about how to spend your block energy.\nThroughout a puzzle there may be various useable objects that can be picked up. Some examples include blueprints, energy units and catapults. It is also possible to change the marble you are using to a different one with other properties. Initially you will just have a single marble but as you progress you will find new marble friends that will join your quest. The idea with this approach is to keep the game interesting, but also to increase the difficulty of the puzzles by having more game mechanics to combine in various ways.\nI have been playing around with different ways to interact with the marble. Initially my idea was that the player would control the marble in a direct fashion by using a game pad or keyboard, but early testing proved that the interesting part of the game was to find solutions to puzzles rather than having direct control over the marble. A bonus of this design decision is that the entire game can be played just by using the mouse. I think this has the big benefit of making the game much easier to approach for non-experienced players.\nThe last couple of weeks I have been working on a level editor. The reason is to simplify puzzle creation but also give future players a way to challenge their creativity. My initial approach was to use Lua for level creation but even though that allowed for fast iteration it is not as straight forward and playful as dragging or \u0026ldquo;painting\u0026rdquo; out various game objects.\nSo how did it go? Overall, I think it went pretty good. I have not been able to finish all the tasks related to the level editor yet, but I think I have a good scalable solution now. Using Dear IMGUI was a good decision, at least it seems like a good choice so far. There are plenty of examples available and the API is clean and easy to use.\nSo what is next? Well, currently I am looking into how to create interesting levels of varying difficulty. I realize that it will take lots of play testing to find the right balance. It is so easy to assume certain things when you design puzzles and these assumptions may prove to be wrong. I am also trying to figure out what game mechanics that will give the game the variation needed to keep players interested. I think am on a good path but I will let future play testing be the judge of that.\nThat is it for this time. Hopefully I can share some more footage from the game and editor in the upcoming weeks.\n","date":1575676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575676800,"objectID":"d7bf0240ca04c712f63da7b91bcc4bf0","permalink":"/post/level-editor/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/level-editor/","section":"post","summary":"I think it is about time I share a bit more information about the game I am working on and what I have been up to during the last couple of weeks.\nThe game is called Marbleous Blocks.

Before I tell you a bit more about Pixleon AB I think it is appropriate to give a short introduction of who I am. My name is Jimmie West, a 35 years old Swedish family man and software developer. It is very important to me to put my family first. If they feel well, I feel well.\nDuring the last 10+ years I have been working at an awesome company called Configura. Configura’s vision is to become the global leader for developing software used to design spaces. It’s been a fun and at times challenging but rewarding journey and I am happy that I got this opportunity.\nLike for many other people my age, my fascination for games started with the NES. While playing most of NES games you really needed to focus, otherwise you would “die” and eventually need to restart the game from the beginning. There was “lots at stake”. I think this formed me as a person quite a bit. For instance, I could spend months just trying to figure out how to make jump with my skateboard, but when I finally figured it out, I felt invincible. In this way I learned that hard work and staying focused usually pays off. My greatest talent is my ability to stay focused and goal oriented.\nSo, why do I want to make games? To become rich and famous? No, not really. The primary driving force for me is the creative freedom and possibility to express and challenge myself through this art form. I refer to it as art rather than engineering even though having engineering skills obviously help with some aspects of game development.\nDuring the upcoming six months I will spend one workday a week developing a puzzle game for PC. At this point the scope seems to be within reach but there is usually a lot of unforeseen events along the road of completing something, but that is also one of the fun parts. In order to be able to work on this from home and still have my son at kindergarten I had to create a company – Pixleon AB. Pixleon is a play on words, pixel and aeon (a long period of time). Pixels represent something creative and fun to me, so it was natural to have something related to that. It was also important to try to find a somewhat short name that is easy to remember.\nNow I hope you have a better idea of who I am and what motivates me. In the upcoming posts I will try to give you more information about the game I am making, the technology behind it and the ideas that go through my head while developing it. Stay tuned.\n","date":1571443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571443200,"objectID":"de17d28cdcb6cdb6a4b5e34c8854faa4","permalink":"/post/hello-world/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hello-world/","section":"post","summary":"Hello fellow reader and welcome to my site where I will be sharing information about myself and my indie game adventure. Before I tell you a bit more about Pixleon AB I think it is appropriate to give a short introduction of who I am. My name is Jimmie West, a 35 years old Swedish family man and software developer. It is very important to me to put my family first.","tags":null,"title":"Hello world","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Marbleous Blocks is point \u0026amp; click, physics based, 3D-puzzle game where you guide Max through a set of challenges.

It is free and available here. Pixleon would be even happier if you would share your impressions. Is is too easy/hard? Which level was most fun? Are the controls intuitive?
